# Showbox Skin
This is a simple edit of Aeon Nox skin to suit my needs for my homemade Showbox.

# How to use this
If you are interested in using this modified skin, the installation process is very simple. Just download this zip in the right top corner and install it from Kodi. It should install without any problems and you should be able to use it.
